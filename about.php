We've built up a strong following of customers, with international testimonials.
Many of them are amazed at the competitive prices and the speed that with we deliver.
Why is our business not advertised locally?
The answer is we are a family business and very down-home and low-key.
We believe that if you treat customers well with fair prices and good friendly service,
supplementing relevant information, those customers will tell their friends about our site,
and will continue to be good customers themselves.
